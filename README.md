# Compatibility Grouping System

This project is a small program that helps automatically group individuals (such as students) based on their compatibility scores gathered through a Google Form. It is especially useful for class group projects, workshops, or events where forming balanced and harmonious teams is essential.

The idea came from a common problem in classrooms or group settings: forming fair and compatible teams.  
Instead of assigning randomly, this system allows group creation based on:
- Shared preferences
- Personality compatibility
- Skill balance
- etc , depends on how the google form is

- 🔢 **Score and rank compatibility between participants**

- 📄 **Export the group list as a readable summary**

## 📂 Folder Structure

- dataset that i already gathered from google form
- the pdf file contains an explanation of this program

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Collect responses** via Google Form (export as `.csv`)
2. Place `form_responses.csv` in the main folder

The system calculated pairwise compatibility and generate a 13 groups (2 people in each group).
